## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added
- Shared `visualizer-core.js` controller (`window.BCViz`) holding all butterchurn
  setup, preset cycling, and audio-device handling.
- `obs.html` — OBS browser-source page with a hideable control panel.
- `fullscreen.html` — standalone keyboard-only fullscreen page.
- Per-page CSS (`panel.css`, `fullscreen.css`) and UI wiring
  (`obs-ui.js`, `fullscreen-ui.js`).
- Docs: OBS setup and audio-routing guides.
- `package.json` with a `start` script for a local static server.

### Notes
- Refactored from two standalone single-file HTML prototypes
  (`butterchurn-obs.html`, `butterchurn-fullscreen.html`) into a shared-core
  repository structure.
